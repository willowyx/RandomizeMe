# Randomize Me!

---

### _what is it?_

you input lists, and it makes randomized sentences from them!

(and!!) it uses seed generation so you can return to the same results, or construct them yourself!

also you can add more lists, so that's neat too.

or if you're feeling extra fancy you can also change the sentences if you want 

### _do I need this?_

yes, of course you do.

### _will this project be updated in the future?_

probably not. This was my first real application and I learned a lot, but I think it's time for me to move on to new
projects :)

### _how do I uninstall?_

### For Mac
Run the ```unins.sh``` script using Terminal. You can use the following command (make sure to elevate):

```sudo sh ~/Library/Application\ Support/RandomizeMe/unins.sh```
### For Windows
Run ```unins000.exe``` in the following directory:

```C:\Program Files\RandomizeMe\unins000.exe```

### _why is it being flagged by my antivirus?_

It really shouldn't be getting flagged, but there's not very much I can do. If you want though, you can build it
yourself for peace of mind. I added some steps below if you wish to do so!

### _how can I build it myself?_
you can use the ```pkg``` directory  to find build files you'll need, and use ```pyinstaller``` or a similar tool to build it.
If you're not sure how to go about it, start with these resources:

- [Install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Install pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/en/stable/installation.html)
- [Use pyinstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/v4.1/usage.html)
